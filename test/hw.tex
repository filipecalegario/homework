\begin{document} \maketitle

This is a demonstration of my homework \LaTeX{} class. It is an extension of the \texttt{amsart} and should have all of its functionality. These are some of the set symbols: $\bC \supset \bR \supset \bQ \supset \bZ \supset \bN$, then some Greek and other mathematical symbols are, $\al, \ep, \p, \ra, \Ra, \injective, \surjective, \bijective$. We can also insert multiple figures as seen in figure \ref{trio}. There is also an \texttt{org-mode} version of this file \footnote{Tashfeen's \texttt{org-mode} configurations can be found \href{https://github.com/simurgh9/emacs786}{here}.}.

\begin{question} Prove that $\exists (x,y) \in \bZ$ such that $x+y = 4$.

  We show,
  \begin{proof} Four is the sum of two integers.
    
    $1,3 \in \bZ$ and $1+3=4$.
  \end{proof}
\end{question}

\begin{bonus} Bonus Question Statement 

  \lipsum[2]
  \[
    \zeta(x) = f(g(x)) \quad \text{ then according to the chain rule: } \quad
    \derivative{\zeta} = \derivative[g]{f} \times \derivative{g}
  \]

\begin{question} What is the cardinality of Natural Numbers?
    
  It is $\aleph_0$ \cite{arlinghaus1996part}.
\end{question}

\begin{question} Is the cardinality of Naturals and Reals the same because they are both infinite?

  No, the cardinality of Reals is greater because they are also un-listable (uncountable).
\end{question}

\begin{question}[99] Custom Numbering.

  This question is numbered 99.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Finally the numbered bullets are done with the \texttt{enumerate} package,

\begin{enumerate}
  \item With just bullets,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \bold{Cats}
    \item \italic{Dogs}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
