This is a demonstration of my homework \LaTeX{} class. It is an extension of the =amsart= and should have all of its functionality. These are some of the set symbols: $\bC \supset \bR \supset \bQ \supset \bZ \supset \bN$, then some Greek and other mathematical symbols are, $\al, \ep, \p, \ra, \Ra, \injective, \surjective, \bijective$. We can also insert multiple figures as seen in figure [[fig:kwarizmi]]. There is also an =org-mode= version of this file[fn:0].

Prove that $\exists (x,y) \in \bZ$ such that $x+y = 4$.

We show,

#+BEGIN_proof
Four is the sum of two integers.
    
$1,3 \in \bZ$ and $1+3=4$.

Bonus Question Statement 
 
\lipsum[2]
\[
\zeta(x) = f(g(x)) \quad \text{ then according to the chain rule: } \quad
\derivative{\zeta} = \derivative[g]{f} \times \derivative{g}
\]

#+BEGIN_question
What is the cardinality of Natural Numbers?

It is $\aleph_0$ [[cite:arlinghaus1996part]].
#+END_question

#+BEGIN_question
Is the cardinality of Naturals and Reals the same because they are both infinite?

No, the cardinality of Reals is greater because they are also un-listable (uncountable).
#+END_question

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [99]
#+BEGIN_question
Custom Numbering.

This question is numbered 99.
#+END_question

#+BEGIN_question
Finally the numbered bullets are done with the =enumerate= package,

1. With just bullets,
   - *Cats*
   - /Dogs/
#+END_question
