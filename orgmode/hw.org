This is a demonstration of my homework \LaTeX{} class. It is an extension of the =amsart= and should have all of its functionality. These are some of the set symbols: $\bC \supset \bR \supset \bQ \supset \bZ \supset \bN$, then some Greek and other mathematical symbols are, $\al, \ep, \p, \ra, \Ra, \injective, \surjective, \bijective$. We can also insert multiple figures as seen in figure \ref{khwarizmi}.

#+BEGIN_question
  Prove that $\exists (x,y) \in \bZ$ such that $x+y = 4$.

  We show,

  #+BEGIN_proof
    Four is the sum of two integers.
    
    $1,3 \in \bZ$ and $1+3=4$.

  Bonus Question Statement 
 
  \lipsum[2]
  \[
    \zeta(x) = f(g(x)) \quad \text{ then according to the chain rule: } \quad
    \derivative{\zeta} = \derivative[g]{f} \times \derivative{g}
  \]

#+BEGIN_question
  What is the cardinality of Natural Numbers?

  It is $\aleph_0$.
#+END_question

#+BEGIN_question
  Is the cardinality of Naturals and Reals the same because they are both infinite?

  No, the cardinality of Reals is greater because they are also un-listable (uncountable).
#+END_question

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [99]
#+BEGIN_question
  Custom Numbering.

  This question is numbered 99.
#+END_question

#+BEGIN_question
  Finally the numbered bullets are done with the =enumerate= package,

  1. With just bullets,
    - *Cats*
    - /Dogs/
